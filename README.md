This is the [QGMLWY keyboard layout](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) modified for Icelandic language use.

The Icelandic characters were not placed in a scientific manner, but like in the original layout, all vowels are positioned on the right half of the keyboard, and all consonants on the left.

### For Icelandic Characters:
| Key Combination | Character |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| alt-gr + a | á |
| alt-gr + e | é |
| alt-gr + o | ó |
| alt-gr + h | æ |
| alt-gr + u | ú |
| alt-gr + y | ý |
| alt-gr + b | ö |
| alt-gr + t | ð |
| alt-gr + n | þ |
